Smth AI, later known as Comet Computer, was the beginning of my mission to make AI agents productive. I cofounded Smth with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deckickham/" class="hover:text-slate-500">Dec</a> with the belief (that still holds as of mid-2024) that a radically new future of work is currently being invented and <a href="/writing/ai-agents" class="hover:text-slate-500">AI agents</a> are a core pillar of that.

### The Spark

A lightbulb went off in my head on 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2023 when Yohei released BabyAGI.

### Smth Launch School

Both myself and Dec are first and foremost builders, and so we were most passionate about serving that customer base. It made a lot of sense - those with less resources and more pressure to iterate quickly stand the most to gain from the exponential reductions in time/cost brought about by AI. As we described in one VC meeting, it's not about somehow increasing the probability that a single idea will succeed (the idea's market is possibly the most efficient and unlikely to change in nature), it was about increasing the chance of founder success by reducing the cost to validate an idea.
Spoke to over 50 entrepreneurs building their ideas and incubated 5 of them
These startups used our suite of AI agents that could:
* Build websites
* Write landing page copy
* Write user research questionnaires
* Create initial brand guides
+ More
To reduce as much friction as possible when going through the initial build-measure-learn loops of validating an idea. We served these through private discord channels where they could interact with agents as bots. We also had a course app where they could access learning materials for the day's session that covered key founding topics like lean startup methodology or customer development.
