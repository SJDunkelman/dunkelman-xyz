Smth AI, later known as Comet Computer, was the beginning of my mission to make AI agents productive. I cofounded Smth with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deckickham/" class="hover:text-slate-500">Dec</a> with the belief (that still holds as of mid-2024) that a radically new future of work is currently being invented and <a href="/writing/ai-agents" class="hover:text-slate-500">AI agents</a> are a core pillar of that.
